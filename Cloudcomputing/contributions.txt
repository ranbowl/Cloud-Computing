As a group, we all have read many paper and formed the understanding of the KSVD algorithm and Cloud algorithms. Based on this understaning, we did the further work as the following:

Xinyu Li & Chenfan Xiao:
Deep understanding of the algorithms, and work together implementing the algorithms on Spark(written in Scala).

Jianing Xu:
Get familiar with AWS and lauched clusters on EMR for experimental evaluations.
